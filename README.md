目前已经有许多推荐系统开源库，但是实现的模型大多比较经典和古老。因此本人决定把一些比较新的，有代表性的工作进行复现，记录自己学习的过程并且分享给大家。
如果有不足之处非常希望大家可以给予指点。

Currently, there are many open-source libraries for recommendation systems, but most of the implemented models are relatively classic and old. Therefore, I decided to reproduce some of the more recent and representative works, record my learning process and share it with everyone. If there are any shortcomings, I would really appreciate your guidance.

DIN（Deep Interest Network for Click-Through Rate Prediction）模型是阿里妈妈团队提出的CTR预估模型，它是一种基于注意力机制的深度兴趣网络模型，用于对用户行为序列数据建模。DIN模型通过引入注意力机制，将用户历史行为序列中的每个行为与候选广告进行交互，从而学习到用户的兴趣偏好，并预测用户是否会点击该广告。

DIN (Deep Interest Network for Click-Through Rate Prediction) model is a CTR prediction model proposed by the Alibaba Mama team. It is a deep interest network model based on attention mechanism used to model user behavior sequence data. The DIN model interacts each behavior in the user’s historical behavior sequence with the candidate advertisement by introducing attention mechanism, thus learning the user’s interest preference and predicting whether the user will click the advertisement.
